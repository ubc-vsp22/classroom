\begin{enumerate}

\item (Simple greedy algorithms: 3 points) Recall programming assignment A02, where Tiffany is given two strings, \texttt{mainString} and \texttt{bag}, and she can select a letter from \texttt{bag} and use it to replace a letter in \texttt{mainString}. (1 point) State the algorithm you designed clearly in pseudo-code (which, as we discussed, is \emph{not} an implementation), (1 point) derive its running time, and (1 point) prove its correctness. 

% 	{\bf Solution.} What we want to find is an ordering (sequence) of the messages such that the corresponding \emph{total weighted transmission time} $T$ (with weights $f_{1}, \dotsc, f_{n}$ corresponding to the ordering) is minimum. The strategy is the following: Transmit the message with the highest weight and shortest length first. To do this, sort the messages in non-increasing order on the basis of the $\frac{f_i}{l_i}$ values. Send the messages in this order. Sorting can be accomplished in $\Theta(n \lg{n})$ time in the worst case (using, say, Merge Sort). 


% 	Let us call our transmission rule Weighted Shortest Message First (WSMF). To prove the optimality of this greedy strategy, suppose a strategy $S$, that is not WSMF, is optimal. In this strategy there must be at least two adjacent messages, say message $j$ followed by
% message $k$, such that
% \begin{align*}
% \frac{f_{j}}{l_{j}} < \frac{f_{k}}{l_{j}}.
% \end{align*}

%   Assume message $j$ starts its processing at time $t$. Perform a so-called \emph{Adjacent Pairwise Interchange} on messages $j$ and $k$. Call the new strategy $S'$. While under the original strategy $S$ message $j$ starts its transmission at time $t$ and is followed by message $k$, under the new strategy $S'$ message $k$ starts transmission at time $t$ and is followed by message $j$. All other messages remain in their original position. The total weighted transmission time of the messages sent before messages $j$ and $k$ is not affected by the interchange. Neither is the total weighted transmission time of the messages sent after messages $j$ and $k$. Thus the difference in the values of the objectives under strategies $S$ and $S'$ is due only to messages $j$ and $k$. Under $S$ the total weighted transmission time of messages $j$ and $k$ is
%   \begin{align*}
%     (t+l_{j})f_{j} +(t+l_{j} +l_{k})f_{k},
%   \end{align*}
% while under $S'$ it is
% \begin{align*}
%  (t+l_{k})f_{k} + (t+l_{k} +l_{j})f_{j}.
% \end{align*}
% If $f_{j}/l_{j} < f_{k}/l_{k}$, then $l_{k}f_{j} < l_{j}f_{k}$, so
% \begin{align*}
%   (t+l_{k})f_{k} + (t+l_{k} +l_{j})f_{j} < (t+l_{j})f_{j} +(t+l_{j} +l_{k})f_{k};
% \end{align*}
% that is, the sum of the two weighted transmission times under $S'$ is strictly less than under $S$. This contradicts the optimality of $S$ and completes the proof of optimality of WSMF. $~~\blacksquare$


\item (Applying graph algorithms: 3 points.)

  \begin{enumerate}    
    
  \item (1 point) Find the shortest path between $s$ and $t$ in the following graph.
    
    \begin{figure}[h]

      \scalebox{0.7}{

  \item We have three containers whose sizes are 10 Liters (L), 7 L, and 4 L, respectively. The 7 L and 4 L containers start out full of water, but the 10 L container is initially empty. We are allowed one type of operation: pouring the contents of one container into another, stopping only when the source container is empty or the destination container is full. We want to know if there is a sequence of pourings that leaves exactly 2 L in the 7 or 4 L container.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item (1 point) Model this as a graph problem: give a precise definition of the
      graph involved by clearly explaining the vertices and edges, and state the specific question about this graph that
      needs to be answered.  
\item (1/2 point) What algorithm should be applied to solve the
      problem?  
    \item (1/2 point) Find the answer by applying the algorithm.
    \end{enumerate}

  \end{enumerate}    
  
\item (Some simple graph properties: 4 points.) Let $G$ be a graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges. Let $M$ be the maximum degree of the vertices of $G$, and let $m$ be the minimum degree of the vertices of $G$. Which of the following propositions must be true? Provide a short proof or counterexample in each case.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item (1/2 point) $2e/v \le M$
		\item (1/2 point) $2e/v \ge m$
		\item (1 point) There exists a simple path (includes no cycles) of length at least $m$
		\item (1 point) $m > 2$ implies that $G$ is connected
		% \item (1 point) $M \le v-1$ if $G$ is a simple graph
        \item (1 point) In every (simple) graph there is a path from any vertex of odd degree to some other vertex of odd degree.
	\end{enumerate}

% \item (Directed acyclic graphs). A directed graph which has no directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Note that the underlying undirected graph may have cycles.
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Show that in any DAG, there is a vertex whose in-degree equals $0$, i.e., it is not the head for any edge. Such a vertex is called a \emph{source}.  
% \item Show that in any DAG, there is a vertex whose out-degree equals 0, i.e., it is not the tail for any edge. Such a vertex is called a \emph{sink}.

% \item Show that in any DAG, one can order the vertices so as to respect edge directions: i.e., show there exists a one-to-one and onto mapping $f : V (G) \to \{1, \dotsc, n\}$ such that for every directed edge $(u, v)$, $f (u) \leq f(v)$. So every edge points from a lower numbered vertex to a higher numbered vertex. This kind of an ordering is called a \emph{topological sort} of the vertices of a DAG.
% \item We say that a partition of the vertices $V = L_{0} \cup \dotsb \cup L_{k-1}$, where $L_{i} \cap L_{j} = \emptyset$ for all $i \neq j$, is a \emph{stratification} with $k$ levels, if every directed edge $e$ is between vertices in different levels, and the edge points from a lower indexed level to a higher indexed level. Notice that the topological sorting from the previous part is a stratification with $|V |$ levels. Let $G_{0}$ be a DAG and let $L_{0}$ be the set of sources in $G_{0}$. Consider the following graphs. For each $i = 1, 2, \dotsc,$ define $G_{i} = G_{i-1} \setminus L_{i-1}$ and $L_{i}$ is the set of sources in $G_{i}$. Notice that for some natural number $k^{*}$, for every $i \geq k^{*}$, $G_{i}$ is just the empty graph, i.e., empty set of vertices and empty set of edges. Show that $V = L_{0} \cup L_{1} \cup \dotsb L_{k^{*}-1}$ is a stratification.
% \item (\textbf{Bonus}) Show that $k^{*}$ in the previous part is the smallest $k \in \N$ such that there exists a stratification with $k$ levels.  
% \end{enumerate}

\item (BONUS. Some more graph properties: 2 points.) Let $m$ be a positive integer and consider a graph $G^{*}$ with $2m$ vertices: $v_{1}, \dots, v_{2m}$. An edge exists between vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ if and only if $(i-j \equiv 1 \mod 2m) \vee (i-j \equiv 2m-1 \mod 2m) \vee (i-j \equiv m \mod 2m)$.
		
		Note that $x \equiv y \mod n$ if and only if $x = kn+y$ for some integer $k$. As examples, $25 \equiv 5 \mod 20$, $29 \equiv -1 \mod 30$ and $29 \equiv 29 \mod 30$.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item (1 point) For each $j \in \{2, \dots, 2m\}$, what is the distance between $v_{1}$ and $v_{j}$? The {\em distance} between two vertices of a graph is the number of edges on the shortest path that connects the two vertices. (Derive an expression in terms of $i$, $j$ and $m$. You will have to consider a few cases.)
		
		\item (1 point) A graph $G$ is $k$-edge-connected if and only if one has to remove $k$ edges to disconnect the graph. Prove that $G^{*}$ is not 4-edge-connected: you can remove three or fewer edges to disconnect the graph.
