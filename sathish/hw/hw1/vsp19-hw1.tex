\begin{itemize}
\item You should work with a partner.
\item You must typeset your solutions.
\item Submit your work using Gradescope by {\bf 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, July 21}.
\item \textbf{Notation.} $\N = \{1,2,\dotsc\} \subset \{0,1,2,\dotsc\} = \Z_{+}$, and $\R_{+} = [0,\infty)$.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{enumerate}
\item (Enter Fibonacci) The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: $F_{0} = F_{1} = 1$, and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for all integers $n \geq 2$.
  \begin{enumerate}
%    \item Use mathematical induction to show that $F_{n} \geq 2^{n/2}$ for all $n \geq 6$. There is more than one base case; identify all base cases!
      \item You are to derive an efficient algorithm to compute the $n$th Fibonacci number. Observe that 
\begin{align*}
  F_{n} & = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\\
  F_{n-1} & = F_{n-1} + 0 \cdot F_{n-2}.
\end{align*}

If we write this linear system in terms of matrices, we have
\begin{align*}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    F_{n} \\ 
  F_{n-1}
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1&1\\
    1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    F_{n-1} \\ 
  F_{n-2}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

Using this linear relation, derive an algorithm to compute $F_{n}$. Your algorithm should run in time $O (\log n)$. \\\ \textbf{Hint:} Use repeated squaring to compute matrix powers.
  
  \item Now suppose that writing every bit of the output to memory counts as an operation that we wish to account for in our running-time analysis (in the previous part, we disregard the time required to write the output to memory). Can you compute $F_{n}$ in time that is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input? Justify your answer.

\item (\textbf{Bonus}) Find $a$ if $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^{17} + bx^{16} + 1$. \textbf{Hint}: The answer is $F_{n}$ for some $n \geq 1$. It is enough to show this and find $n$ explicitly; you do not need to compute $F_{n}$. 
  \end{enumerate}
% \item \textbf{A Gentle Mathematical Warm-up.} 
%   Here we will show that for every positive integer $n$, it is necessary
%   for $2^n + 1$ to be a prime number that $n$ is a \emph{power of two}. In
%     other words, we will prove the statement ``if $n$ a positive integer and
%     $2^n + 1$ is prime, then $n$ is a power of two.''
%     \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Show that for any reals $a$ and $b$, $a \neq b$, and positive integer $n$,
%       $(a-b) | (a^n - b^n)$. Do \emph{not} use induction! \textbf{Hint}: Use
%       geometric series to expand $a^n - b^n$.
%     \item Deduce that if $n$ is a positive integer and $2^{n}+1$ is prime,
%       then $n = 2^{k}$ for some $k\geq 0$. \textbf{Hint:} Assume
%       that $n$ is not a power of two but $2^{n} + 1$ is prime, and use the
%       previous part to arrive at a contradiction.
%     \item Accordingly, is $2^{50} + 1$ a prime number? Can you conclude using
%       the previous part solely whether or not $257$ is prime? Justify your
%       answers.
%     \end{enumerate}

    
% \item \textbf{Enter Fibonacci.} The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: $F_{0} = F_{1} = 1$, and $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for all integers $n \geq 2$.
%   \begin{enumerate}    
%   \item Use mathematical induction to show that $F_{n} \geq 2^{n/2}$ for all $n \geq 6$. There is more than one base case; identify all base cases!

% \item (\textbf{Bonus}) Find $a$ if $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $x^2 - x - 1$ is a factor of $ax^{17} + bx^{16} + 1$. \textbf{Hint}: The answer is $F_{n}$ for some $n \geq 1$. It is enough to show this and find $n$ explicitly; you do not need to compute $F_{n}$.

% \item (Studyitis) During VSP 2018, the students are sitting in an $n \times n$ grid. A sudden outbreak of studyitis (a rare condition that lasts forever; symptoms include yearning for homework) causes some students to get infected. The infection begins to spread every minute (in discrete time-steps). Two students are considered adjacent if they share an edge (i.e., front, back, left or right, but NOT diagonal); thus, each student is adjacent to 2, 3 or 4 others. A student is infected in the next time step if either
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item the student was previously infected (there is no cure for this condition), or
%   \item the student is adjacent to {\em at least two} students who are affected by studyitis.
%   \end{itemize}
  
%   Prove that if less than $n$ students are initially infected then the whole class will not be completely infected.
  
%   \textbf{Hint:} Can you identify some property at the initial stage and prove, by induction, that this property is preserved at each time step? Think of {\em invariants}.

\item (Time Complexity)

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Algorithms $A$ and $B$ spend exactly $T_{A}(n) = 0.1n^{2} \log_{10} (n)$ and $T_{B}(n) = 2.5n^{2}$ microseconds, respectively, for a problem of size $n$. Choose the algorithm, which is better in the Big-Oh sense, and find out a problem size $n_{0}$ such that for any larger size $n > n_{0}$ the chosen algorithm outperforms the other. If your problems are of the size $n \leq 10^{9}$, which algorithm will you recommend to use?
\item Let $f(n) = (\log n)^{\log n}$ and $g(n) = 2^{(\log_{2} n)^{2}}$. Determine whether $f \in O(g)$, $f \in \Omega(g)$, or both (in which case $f \in \Theta(g)$).
\item Show that for any $f,g: \Z_{+} \to \R_{+}$, $O(f+g) = O\bigl(\max\{f,g\}\bigr)$. Recall that $O(\cdot)$ is a set (see notes \#1), and therefore one has to show both $O(f+g) \subset O\bigl(\max\{f,g\}\bigr )$ and $O\bigl (\max\{f,g\} \bigr ) \subset O(f+g)$.
% \item Find the running time of the following procedure in Big-Oh notation.

% \begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align*}
%     &\underline{\textsc{Foo}(N)}\\
%     & k \leftarrow 0\\
%     & \text{for } i \leftarrow 1 \text{ to } N\\
%     & \qquad \text{for } j \leftarrow 1 \text{ to } N\\
%     & \qquad \qquad k \leftarrow i+j\\
%     & \text{return } k 
% \end{empheq}


  \end{enumerate}

%\item (Testing i*Phones.) You are testing the physical durability of the new i*Phones to determine the (maximum) height from which they can fall and still not break. You are performing this testing in increments of half a feet. You want to find the largest height, $X$, from which an i*Phone can be safely dropped. If you wanted to minimize the number of devices used for this test, you could start at 0.5 feet, and keep increasing the height to a maximum of $H \times 0.5$ feet, until a drop breaks the device. This sequential test would require only one device for testing but would require (potentially) a large number of tests. There is a natural tradeoff between the number of devices you break during the testing and number of tests performed. (For example, a binary search between $0$ and $H$ would require $\log{H}$ devices in the worst case.) 
%	
%	Suppose your manager at a*Pple Corp. limits you to a testing budget of $n$ devices, determine an efficient strategy for identifying $X$. Let $g_{n}(H)$ be the number of tests needed by a strategy given a maximum height $H$ and $n$ devices. A strategy is efficient if $\lim_{H \to \infty} g_{n}(H)/g_{n-1}(H) = 0$.
%	
%	{\em Clearly describe your testing strategy and prove that it is indeed efficient.}
